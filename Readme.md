2. Directory containing low resolution meshes used for stimuli generation (lowpoly).
3. Directory containing matlab scripts that allow JOD scaling of the attached results and
computing correlation coefficients for metrics mentioned in the paper (analysis).
4. CSV file providing general information on the meshes (Dataset.csv).
5. CSV file containing responses from the conducted subjective study (SubjectiveData.csv)
